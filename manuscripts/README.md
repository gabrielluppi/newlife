##Just an exercise about creating folders.
###Here's the explanation:
Exercise 3: Create folders

Discuss among your lab what folders your repository will contain - some examples include: 
manuscripts, data, figures, scripts, scripts/users/personal_folder_your_name. To make a new folder, 
click on Create new file and add in the name of your new folder, e.g. manuscripts/ before the file name, 
in this case a quick README.md file. When creating folders within your repo through GitHub’s website, you 
always need to make at least one file associated with them, you can’t just create an empty folder. Add a brief 
explanation of what the folder is for in the README.md file, scroll down and click on Commit new file. Add a quick 
message where it says Create README.md file in light grey text - we will cover GitHub etiquette later, but for now, 
when creating/editing files, it’s always a good idea to change the default message to a more precise description 
of what was done and who did it. Stick with the default option of Commit directly to master branch - we will explain 
branches and pull requests at a later stage of the tutorial.
